### For Smithery (Cloud Deployment)

Deploy instantly to Smithery's hosted platform:

[![Deploy to Smithery](https://smithery.ai/badge)](https://smithery.ai/server/@iclickfreedownloads/smithery-protocol-airbnb)

Smithery deployment uses HTTP transport for better scalability, load balancing, and auto-scaling.

### For Claude Desktop & Cursor (Local/CLI)

This server can run locally using stdio transport.

#### For Claude Desktop
This extension is packaged as a Desktop Extension (DXT) file. To install:

1. Download the `.dxt` file from the releases page
2. Open your compatible AI application (e.g., Claude Desktop)
3. Install the extension through the application's extension manager
4. Configure the extension settings as needed

#### For Cursor, etc.

Before starting make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your desktop for `npx` to work.
1. Go to: Cursor Settings > Tools & Integrations > New MCP Server

2. Add one the following to your `mcp.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "airbnb": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@openbnb/mcp-server-airbnb"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    To ignore robots.txt for all requests, use this version with `--ignore-robots-txt` args

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "airbnb": {
          "command": "npx",
